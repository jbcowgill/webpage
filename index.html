        <h2>Hallucinations may be a property of cognition</h2>

        <p>What is the difference between <strong>hallucinations</strong> and accurate outputs from GPT-4? This is incredibly difficult to discern since a hallucination is produced in the same way correct outputs are produced. <strong>AGI </strong> is a major topic of discussion lately, as AI seems to be advancing every week. Which brings us to the OpenAI drama from a few weeks ago where charismatic CEO Sam Altman was kicked out of his own company. He was eventually hired back, but the reason for his firing remains a mystery. There was supposedly a letter from researchers that there was a startling jump in performance from their Q* model, which may have prompted the board to act as they did.</p>

        <h3>Sam Altman</h3>

        <p>
          He has been all over the news and was recently named CEO of the year by Time magazine. He helped bring OpenAI from a market cap of 0$ to $100 billion in a few years. Microsoft tried desperately to court him during his ouster </p>
